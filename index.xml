      <title>Packaging Updates for 10.6.0</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Packaging and building binaries for releases and testing has long been an issue for us. From fighting with duct-tape-and-coat-hanger scripts, to testing breaking changes, to massaging official releases, how we were doing things for the last year-and-a-half needed some improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, today they are all completed. In this post, I&#39;ll detail the changes as well as what the entail for our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a brief TL;DR: for most users of our stable releases, not much will change, and you will upgrade to 10.6.0 as you always have. For anyone using nightlies for testing, advanced setups, or who are just curious - read on!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Jellyfin in 2019</title>
      <link>https://jellyfin.org/posts/jellyfin-in-2019/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It feels hard to believe, but the Jellyfin project is now over a year old. With our official founding somewhere around December 8th 2018, Andrew and I weren&#39;t sure exactly what was going to happen. Did we have the resources to make a fork of Emby really happen? Were the doubters right in saying that we wouldn&#39;t last a year? It seems that we&#39;ve proven them, and ourselves, wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Welcome to the New Website!</title>
      <link>https://jellyfin.org/posts/welcome/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our brand new website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it may not look like much has changed - the theme and colours are still the same, and so is our frontpage. What has changed, is what&#39;s under the hood. Our website is now built using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, a static-page generator written in Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the move, we&#39;ve decided to introduce this new blog, where you&#39;ll be able to hear more about Jellyfin&#39;s new releases, future development, and goals. Occasionally, we&#39;ll feature guest posts from some of our own contributors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
